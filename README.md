# Lossless-Image-Compression-State-of-the-Art-Analysis-and-Efficient-Solutions-Using-Python

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on lossless image compression. The main objective is to explore the concepts of information theory, specifically in relation to compression theory, and propose an efficient non-destructive compression solution for grayscale images. The project emphasizes the proposal, justification, and validation of the solution rather than the implementation itself. Existing code from external sources can be utilized, as long as proper attribution is provided. Any programming language can be used, but the solution must be well-structured, documented, and integrated to allow for execution and result verification by the instructors.
